# Clock

A short program of a clock that works through if statements and while loops.
At the moment, I am aware of the tools I can use to allow the clock program to allow, for example:

"05:09:09"

But I tend to overthink sometimes and recently I've been trying to figure out what I can do to allow the clock to output the "0" fillers.

I will upgrade this and soon, build various timers as well!
